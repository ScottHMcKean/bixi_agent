## Go faster and further with an electric BIXI!

Wouldn’t it be great if you could ride your bike without ever getting exhausted? Here’s the key: the [Electric BIXI](https://bixi.com/en/ebike/)! It’s been picking up in popularity for so many great reasons. As soon as your electric BIXI detects you’re having trouble pedalling—whether it’s because you’re tired or riding uphill— it provides assistance proportional to the effort required to keep you going at a good pace, making them extremely pleasant to ride. Rumour has it that they can even **make you feel like you’re flying**!

For some users, electric BIXIs are a simple pleasure, a luxury that they offer themselves from time to time. For others, they are an essential means of transportation in order to **arrive fresh and ready to go** after a ride **to the top of the hill**. One thing is certain: they leave no one indifferent. It’s little wonder that the largest fleet in North America is found right here in Montreal!

Not yet convinced they’re worthy of their reputation? The BIXI seasonal membership allows you to **put them to the test** for a small fee: as a member, your electric bike rental will cost only **18₵/minute** as opposed to 35₵/minute for non-members.\*

\* Billing of usage fees is processed to your account on the 20th day of each month.

## Facilitate your trips by downloading the BIXI mobile application

The mobile app is an essential tool to get the most out of your BIXI seasonal membership! A [map of Greater Montreal](https://secure.bixi.com/map/) displays **all bike routes and BIXI stations** and enables you to check the availability of regular BIXIs, electric BIXIs and docking points at each station. It also gives you an **easy way to rent a bike, right in your pocket**: simply click on “Unlock” and scan the QR code of the BIXI you wish to use.

But that’s not all! A **stopwatch** is activated at the beginning of your trip and allows you to **control your BIXI use** by providing you with the exact duration of your excursion. Not sure if you’ve properly returned your BIXI to the station after a trip? Not a problem! The BIXI app sends you a **notification once your bike rental has ended**.

Are there other advantages to the BIXI app? Certainly! Find out more by clicking the button below.
