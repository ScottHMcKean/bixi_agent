## FAQ

So that you have all the information you need when introducing the program to your organization, here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about the BIXI Corporate Program and the group rate.

Which membership does the group rate apply to?

The 10% discount offered under the BIXI Corporate Program applies only to the seasonal membership. It is available from April 15 to May 31, 2025.

What is the minimum group size to benefit from the group rate?

A minimum of 20 people is required to participate in the BIXI Corporate Program and benefit from the 10% discount.

What costs are covered by the group?

The group covers all or part of the membership fee. The membership fee is split as follows:

- 10% discount offered by BIXI
- 0% to 90% discount offered by the organization
- Remaining portion, if any, to be paid by the member

When launching the program, the organization determines whether it wishes to offer an additional discount, and the amount of this discount. The group rate is then communicated to employees. All additional charges for trips of more than 45 minutes or for electric BIXI trips will be charged to the member’s personal credit card.

Why must I add a personal credit card?

A credit card is required to pay the portion of the membership fee that is not covered by BIXI or the organization, as well as any additional fees for trips of more than 45 minutes or for electric BIXI trips. These remain the responsibility of the member.

I subscribed online. Can I use the service right away?

Seasonal membership is valid from April 15 to November 15. During this period, you can start using your membership at any time using the BIXI application or your credit card associated with the account.

Where can I find my group promotional code?

Contact your group to get your promotional code.

Do I have to use my organization’s e-mail address to become a member?

You can register/login with your existing e-mail address, or with the e-mail address associated with your account if you already have one. You will be asked to enter your business e-mail address at checkout to verify your eligibility, if required by your program.

What happens if I leave my organization?

You can keep your corporate membership until the end of its validity period. After that, you’ll have the option of buying a seasonal membership at the regular rate, or joining another group to continue enjoying the group rate.

What are the additional fees?

Regular BIXI – Trips over 45 minutes: 18₵/minute +tx  
Electric BIXI – From the first minute: 18₵/minute +tx

How are additional charges billed?

Additional fees (if applicable) for trips of more than 45 minutes on regular BIXI or electric BIXI trips are charged to your credit card once a month, on the 20th day of each month. The billing statement for your trips is available in your BIXI Space on the website, in the Billing Statements section.
