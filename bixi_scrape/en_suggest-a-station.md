## Frequently asked questions

If you need help, don’t hesitate to [contact us](https://bixi.com/en/contact-us/).

How does it work?

You must use the link to access the platform. From here, you are invited to identify yourself, suggest a station location and provide us with the main reason for the suggestion.

If I suggest a location, when will I get my station?

Submitting a suggestion does not guarantee the installation of a station at the identified location. The goal is to enrich the planning process of the BIXI network.

If I live outside of the current network, am I allowed to suggest a location?

Yes! We’re inviting all Quebecers to suggest a station location in their city where they’d like to use the service.

Can I suggest several stations?

Absolutely! It is possible to suggest as many stations as you want.

How are the station locations determined?

Station locations are determined on the basis of a number of factors, including user potential, regulations, the space available to accommodate the station, agreement with the borough and/or landowner, the possibility of connecting an electric station, etc.

Our planning team carefully studies the possibilities and suggestions received, then determines the optimal network.
