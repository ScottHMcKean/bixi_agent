## Ride safely

Your safety while riding a bike is very important. That‚Äôs why we remind you that, when you rent a trailer :

- Maximum trailer load is 50¬†kg.
- Load must be secured in the trailer to prevent any movement.
- Adapted driving is essential. The trailer lengthens the braking distance and can affect the bike‚Äôs stability, especially when making a turn.
- Your personal bike must be in good condition. If it has a seatpost with a circumference of less than 31.6¬†mm, you‚Äôll need an adapter (available in bike stores).

It is forbidden to :

- Carry people or pets in the trailer.
- Tow 2¬†trailers simultaneously.
- Attach the trailer to a motorized vehicle (e.g. scooter, motorcycle, car).
- Use the trailer on unpaved or non-concrete surfaces.

## Secure the trailer while you run errands

A lock is built into the trailer to allow you to stop and run errands during your rental. Using the lock does not pause your rental. As the trailer cannot be used by another BIXIST, time continues to run when it is attached.

Despite its effectiveness when used to secure the trailer to a solid support, the lock is not infallible. The trailer ceases to be your responsibility only when it is returned to the station.

## Locate BIXI trailers via the mobile app!

Thanks to its map, the app shows you in real time all the stations where an available trailer is waiting for you. Easy to locate, they are identified by a pictogram. It‚Äôs also possible to apply a ‚ÄúTrailer‚Äù filter to the map, so that it only shows stations with one!

But that‚Äôs not all! A timer is activated as soon as you start your journey with the trailer, informing you of the passed rental time so that you can return the trailer on time.
