## Discover the BIXI trailer

Designed and manufactured in Quebec, the BIXI trailer is a home-grown innovation. It was designed to improve the urban experience and your daily life, in response to a simple question:

“BIXI bikes are all well and good, but what do you do when you need to carry things?”

Find out how to locate the trailer on the station map, attach it to your bike and use it safely for your first ride.

## Looking to rent a BIXI bike as well?

Would towing the trailer with an electric BIXI or leaving your personal bike at home simplify your life?

Choose the $9.50 [One-Way + Trailer Pass](http://www.bixi.com/en/one-way-and-trailer-pass), which also includes the cost of unlocking a BIXI bike. You’ll pay the same per-minute usage fee for the bike you choose as for the [One-Way Pass](https://bixi.com/en/one-way-passes/).

Need to rent a BIXI trailer regularly? Choose the [Monthly Membership](https://bixi.com/en/monthly-membership/)! The rental price will be cut in half ($4) and no security deposit will be required.
